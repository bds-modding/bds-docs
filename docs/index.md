Welcome to ```bds-docs```, this is documentation to help you explore and understand the vastness of the inner-workings relating to the Bedrock Dedicated Server. This is supposed to be similar to [this](https://mojang.github.io/bedrock-protocol-docs) created by Mojang, however community-run and with a LOT more information.

## Why is this documentation needed?
Mojang, sadly, decided to remove symbols (literally ONE .pdb file) from BDS causing us to lose lots of valuable information from the Dedicated Server Software. According to Mojang, this to **"increase security"**, however in reality, this makes it **harder for modders and server developers to do what they do best**.

With this documentation, we strive to fill in the gap left by the symbols, with lots of reference information that you can use instead.

## What is the latest IDA Database for Minecraft BDS?
The latest and most likely last IDA database avaliable is for Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server v1.20.81.01 which you can find [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ammda8wfvbw9x/The_Flopper_Databases) along with the databases for many other versions. If you Ghidra, then welp sucks to be you!
